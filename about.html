        <p id="span1">Syria (Arabic: سوريا‎, romanized: Sūriyā), officially the Syrian Arab Republic (Arabic:
            الجمهورية العربية السورية‎, romanized: al-Jumhūrīyah al-ʻArabīyah as-Sūrīyah), is a country in Western Asia,
            bordering Lebanon to the southwest, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the
            east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and
            deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Syrian Arabs, Greeks, Armenians,
            Assyrians, Kurds, Circassians,[8] Mandeans[9] and Turkemens. Religious groups include Sunnis, Christians,
            Alawites, Druze, Isma'ilis, Mandeans, Shiites, Salafis, Yazidis, and Jews. Sunnis make up the largest
            religious group in Syria. </p>
        <p id="span2">Syria is a unitary republic consisting of 14 governorates and is the only country that
            politically espouses Ba'athism. It is a member of one international organization other than the United
            Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement; it has been suspended from the Arab League in November 2011[10] and the
            Organisation of Islamic Cooperation,[11] and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean.[12]</p>
        <p id="span3">The name "Syria" historically referred to a wider region, broadly synonymous with the Levant,
            and known in Arabic as al-Sham. The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and
            empires, including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC. Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are
            among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.[13] In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat
            of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. The modern Syrian state
            was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman and a brief period French mandate, and
            represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces.</p>
        <p id="span4">It gained de jure independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945, when Republic of
            Syria became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate –
            although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946. The post-independence period was
            tumultuous, with many military coups and coup attempts shaking the country from 1949 to 1971. In 1958, Syria
            entered a brief union with Egypt called the United Arab Republic, which was terminated by the 1961 Syrian
            coup d'état. </p>
